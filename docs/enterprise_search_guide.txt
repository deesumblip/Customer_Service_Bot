TITLE: Enterprise Search (RAG) Integration Guide
TAGS: rag, retrieval, search, knowledge, enterprise search

OVERVIEW
Enterprise Search integrates retrieval-augmented generation into Rasa assistants.
It indexes plain-text documents from ./docs and uses embeddings to find relevant passages.

TRAIN-TIME INDEXING
- Place .txt files under ./docs (subfolders allowed).
- Run: rasa train
- The training process chunks and embeds documents and writes a vector index (FAISS by default).

RUNTIME BEHAVIOR
- The LLM command generator may emit a knowledge-answer command for informational queries.
- The pattern_search flow should call: action_trigger_search
- The policy retrieves top passages and prompts the answer LLM with grounded context.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If the assistant replies with generic chit-chat, check pattern_search is overridden.
- If answers are empty, confirm the .txt files exist and retrain.

VALIDATION EXAMPLE
Q: "Which color is safe for deployments?"
A: "Ultramarine kiwi" (from canary.txt).

What Is Fuelservice fuelService is an app that allows drivers with physical limitations to contact Shell service stations to request assistance with refuelling before making a journey. Once help is confirmed, you can use the app to notify the station when you arrive. We make customers aware of our mobile payments offer Pay at Pump via the Shell app, but you can also pay via card or cash. Please click here to see the service in action.

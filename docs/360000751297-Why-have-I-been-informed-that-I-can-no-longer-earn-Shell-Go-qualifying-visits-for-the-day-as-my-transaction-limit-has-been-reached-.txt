Why Have I Been Informed That I Can No Longer Earn Shell Go Qualifying Visits For The Day As My Transaction Limit Has Been Reached A maximum of 3 qualifying visits per day can be credit to your account. These visits will need to meet the minimum spend required for fuel and/or non-fuel related products. Please note, if 2 or more visits occur within 10 minutes of each other both transaction will be amalgamated and will count as one qualifying visit.

Why Is It Showing The Full Fuelling Limit In My Apple Wallet Transactions Instead Of The Amount I Filled Up dont worry the card attached to your Apple Wallet has not been charged for the full amount shown, only the amount you used. the Apple Wallet shows full pre-authorisation amounts you can check this in your bank account or credit card statement or on the receipt you will be emailed.

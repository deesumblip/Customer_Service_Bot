What Are Carbon Emissions Carbon emissions are produced when we make and use products in our day to day lives. The same applies for the fuel you use to drive. Carbon emissions are generated when we produce the fuel, when we distribute it to your local service station and when you drive. As more carbon emissions build up in our atmosphere, this causes more heat from the sun to be trapped, which heats up our planet this is known as global warming. There are ways in which we can help reduce the amount of carbon emissions we generate by consuming fewer products or choosing products which have a lower carbon impact.

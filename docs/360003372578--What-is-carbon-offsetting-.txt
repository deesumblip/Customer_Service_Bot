What Is Carbon Offsetting Its all a balancing act, compensating for carbon emissions that are produced elsewhere. To enable our customers to drive carbon neutral, we buy carbon credits from carbon offset schemes that invest in the protection and replanting of forests around the world in order to balance out the carbon emissions from the production, distribution and use of fuel. As forests, grasslands and wetlands store carbon from the atmosphere, protecting and replanting these environments means we can offset the carbon emissions from your fuel purchases.

How Does Oil Protect My Engine By helping to keep it clean Engine oils like Shell Helix help prevent sludge and other deposits from hindering engine operation, safely holding onto these materials until your next oil change. By reducing friction and wear - Engine oils like Shell Helix reduce friction, to improve fuel economy, they also protect critical engine surfaces from wear during engine operation. By removing heat - Shell Helix oils carry heat away from hot areas, such as around the piston rings where temperatures can reach 320C, and redistribute it around the engine. By preventing corrosion and rust - Shell Helix oils are specially formulated to help prevent rust and corrosion that damage engine parts and shorten engine life.

Can I Still Earn Avios At Shell Shell Drivers' Club has now closed. If you have chosen to receive Avios instead of fuel vouchers as your reward these will be transferred to your British Airways Executive Club account providing you have supplied us with your BAE account number in our final statement at the end of August. Our new reward programme is called "Shell Go+" and provides savings, surprise freebies and money off fuel. We will no longer be offering Avios in the new programme. For further queries, you may chat with us below on Live Chat (during business hours - 8:00AM to 4:45PM Monday to Friday); or you may contact us here.

How Do I Choose A Charity To Support You will have received an email on the first day of the promotion (6th May 2021) from Shell Go+ asking you to choose the charity you would like to support. Simply click on the link below the charity logo in the email to select it and then scan your Shell Go+ barcode every time you make a qualifying visit to a Shell site to provide support to the charity you have chosen. If you missed the first email, dont panic. We will be sending reminders throughout the campaign to encourage everyone to take part. If you are new to Shell Go+ dont worry, you will also be sent the email after you have registered.

Do I Need To Take Off My Helmet When I Fill Up My Motorbike Station staff need to be able to identify that customers who are filling up and making payments at Shell service stations are over the age of 16. Therefore we may ask motorcyclists to lift their visor or remove their helmet so that our station staff can verify their age. In some areas of the country, local police have made a request for motorcyclists to remove their helmets whilst refuelling and making payments. In these areas we are supporting local police with this request and will ask that all motorcyclists remove helmets.

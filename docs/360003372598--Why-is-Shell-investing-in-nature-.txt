Why Is Shell Investing In Nature The science is clear: working with nature is an essential element of the climate challenge we collectively face. Scientists estimate that nature based solutions such as reforestation could provide more than one-third of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed between now and 2030 to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Shell is using these nature-based offsetting projects as one of the many ways we are reducing the overall carbon impact from the products we sell.

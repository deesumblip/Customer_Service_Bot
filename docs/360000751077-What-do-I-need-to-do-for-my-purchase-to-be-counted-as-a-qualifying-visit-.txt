What Do I Need To Do For My Purchase To Be Counted As A Qualifying Visit You will need to spend 10 on fuel or 2 in the shop on selected products. If 2 or more of your transactions occur within 10 minutes of each other, only the first will count as a qualifying visit. Items you can purchase in the shop counts towards the visit but this does exclude tobacco, lottery tickets, spirits, phone cards and any other age restricted products.

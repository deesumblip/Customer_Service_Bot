How Does Let S Do Some Good Work Help support a charity with Shell Go+. As a Shell Go+ member, you can help support a charity by making a qualifying visit and scanning your Shell Go+ barcode. You will be sent an email from Shell Go+ asking you choose one of the following charities to support: St John Ambulance, Samaritans or NSPCC. You will then need to click on the link below your chosen charity within the email and be directed to a confirmation page. Once you have selected a charity, every time you scan your Go+ barcode at a Shell station until 7th July 2021 a vote will be allocated to your chosen charity to win a donation. Each scan is one vote, its as simple as that. The charity with the most votes on 7th July 2021 will receive a 60,000 donation from Shell. The two remaining charities will also receive a donation (20,000) to support the incredible work they have done, especially during these challenging times.

TITLE: CALM Overview (Conversational AI with Language Models)
TAGS: calm, architecture, flows, patterns, dialogue

WHAT IS CALM?
CALM is Rasa's architecture that combines LLM-based understanding with deterministic dialogue execution.
The LLM interprets what the user means; flows, actions, and patterns control what the assistant does.

KEY IDEAS
- Dialogue Understanding: an LLM reads the full conversation and proposes commands.
- Flows: deterministic, testable sequences that define business logic.
- Conversation Patterns: global handlers for chit-chat, clarifications, corrections, or knowledge search.
- Separation of Concerns: language understanding is flexible; execution remains controlled.

WHY FLOWS MATTER
Flows prevent hallucinated operations. The assistant only executes capabilities defined by the developer.

CONVERSATION REPAIR
If a user digresses, a pattern can address the digression and the assistant can resume the original flow.

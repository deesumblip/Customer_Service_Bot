Why Did I Not Get A Visit In My Go Tracker When I Used Pay At Pump We are working hard to fully integrate our mobile payment function, Fill up & Go, into our Go+ reward programme. Until this time you may experience a delay in seeing your qualifying visit appear on your Go+ tracker. Please be aware that this delay can be anywhere between a 24 hr to 4 day (Friday- Monday) lapse time. If you need further help on this subject you can chat with us during business hours - 8:00AM to 4:45PM Monday to Friday. Please click on "chat with us" which you will see below.

What Is The Difference Between A Rapid A Fast And A High Powered Charger Shell Recharge offers rapid chargers which are our 50kW chargers and typically charge most EVs in approximately 30 minutes*. High-powered chargers are 150kW chargers and can deliver power up to three times faster*. Fast chargers are usually either 7kW or 22 kW and so take longer to charge your car. These chargers are usually located in areas where the EV will be parked for a longer time (e.g. car parks). *Results may vary, no guarantees provided. Charging speed depends on several factors including temperature outside, type of car, size of battery and battery condition. Please check with your OEM for compatibility and further information.

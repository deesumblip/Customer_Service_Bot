What you can do: check GPS is enabled and try again pay in the shop instead Technical Issue could mean there was an error with the system that runs Pay at Pump you can either try again delete and redownload the app or choose to pay in the shop - youll need to get the pump manually authorised by the Customer Assistant before filling up.

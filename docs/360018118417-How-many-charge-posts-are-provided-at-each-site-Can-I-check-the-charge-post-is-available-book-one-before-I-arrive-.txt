How Many Charge Posts Are Provided At Each Site Can I Check The Charge Post Is Available Book One Before I Arrive Most of our sites have one post available. We are working on providing multiple posts on as many sites as possible. Although customers cannot reserve a charging post in advance, you can check if the charge post is available using the Smoov or Shell Recharge apps. Within the apps, Shell Recharge locations are marked with the Shell logo above a circle. This circle appears green when the charge post is available and red when in use.

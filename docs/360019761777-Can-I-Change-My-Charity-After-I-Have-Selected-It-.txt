Can I Change My Charity After I Have Selected It Unfortunately no, once you have chosen one of the 3 charities to support it cannot be changed. You will support one charity throughout the duration of the campaign. If you try to select a different charity or to select more than one charity, the first charity you select will be the one recorded and will be the one that you support.

How Can You Say It Will Take 30 Minutes Aren T All Cars Different Yes, we understand that all cars are different, and it is the car which manages the speed of the charge. However, we quote 30 minutes as a guide for our customers, as our 50kW charge posts can deliver 50kW of charge which typically enables most cars to charge 0-80% in approximately 30 mins. Cars that are able to take advantage of the full speed offered by the 150kW charger generally have larger batteries and so require a faster charge to fill the battery in similar amounts of time*. *As per the Fastned website, the vehicle models that benefit from charging at speeds over 50kW include: Hyundai Ioniq, Hyundai KONA, Kia e-Niro, Jaguar I-PACE, Mercedes-Benz EQC, Audi e-tron Quattro and Tesla model 3.

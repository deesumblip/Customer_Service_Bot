TITLE: Flows and Conversation Patterns Primer
TAGS: flows, patterns, design, conversation repair

FLOWS
- Deterministic steps (ask, set slots, run actions, utter responses).
- Ideal for transactional logic and safe execution paths.

PATTERNS
- Global handlers that can interrupt or assist flows.
- Examples: pattern_search (knowledge), pattern_chitchat (small talk).

EXAMPLE DESIGN
User: "Help me configure search."
- LLM recognizes a knowledge request → pattern_search
- pattern_search calls action_trigger_search → retrieves docs → grounded answer
- If user digresses, pattern_chitchat handles it and conversation can resume.

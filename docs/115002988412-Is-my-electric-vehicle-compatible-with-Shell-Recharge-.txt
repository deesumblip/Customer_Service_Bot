Is My Electric Vehicle Compatible With Shell Recharge Shell Recharge is compatible with most EVs as our rapid 50kW and high-powered 150kW direct current (DC) chargers are designed to work with most vehicle types that are currently on the road. We provide connections for combined charging systems and CHAdeMO on both 50kW and 150kW chargers, as well as AC Type 2 (43kW) on the 50kW charge posts. Tesla adaptors are not supplied but drivers can use their own adaptors on the CHAdeMO connector

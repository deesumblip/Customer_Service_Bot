How Are Carbon Emissions Calculated Different fuels emit different volumes of carbon emissions during the production of the fuel, the distribution of it to your local forecourt and through driving. At Shell we use government emissions factors, unique to your fuel type to calculate the amount of carbon emissions that need to be offset, relevant to the volume of fuel youve purchased.

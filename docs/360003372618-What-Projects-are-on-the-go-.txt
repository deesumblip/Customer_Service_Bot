What Projects Are On The Go Shell has a portfolio of projects around the world it supports which help to protect and restore natural ecosystems like forests and rainforests. One conservation project is The Cordillera Azul National Park project, between the Andes and the Amazon basin in Peru, which includes 3.7 million hectares of forest, much of which is under threat. Another is Katingan Mentaya project in Indonesia, which not only reduces carbon emissions but protects and conserves biodiversity and enables the sustainable development of local communities. As well as buying carbon offsets from projects around the globe, Shell has sourced some carbon credits from within the UK, including the Overkirkhope Project in the Scottish borders and the Longwood Project in Cumbria, both woodland creation projects verified to the UK Woodland Carbon Code. Shell will also be providing support to Forestry and Land Scotland. Shell is working with Forestry and Land Scotland to establish trees and this work will ultimately generate carbon credits.

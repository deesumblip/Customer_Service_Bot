Do I Need To Put In My Vehicle Registration On The Order Shell Go Card Page It is optional to submit your vehicle registration number when you order a Shell Go+ card. Please note that you can only have 1 card/key fob for your account so if you have other family members who would like to use the Shell Go+ scheme they will need to create a separate account so that they can order their own card/key fob set.

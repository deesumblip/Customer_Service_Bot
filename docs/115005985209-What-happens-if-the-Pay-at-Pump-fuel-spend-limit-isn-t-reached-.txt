What Happens If The Pay At Pump Fuel Spend Limit Isn T Reached Youll only be charged for fuel you dispense, regardless of the limit set. As soon as you start a fuel transaction, your bank pre-authorises (reserves) your maximum fuelling limit amount to ensure its available for you to pay with. If you have mobile banking, you may see this amount pop up. When you finish fuelling, we tell your bank the real amount you spent, they deduct it, and arrange to unreserve the pre-authorised amount. This process can take a few minutes to a few days depending on who you bank with.
